      <h1>Frontend developer</h1>
      <p>I have been thinking about the IT industry for a long time, but due to professional commitments, I could not make the decision to change the industry before. In recent months, I have successfully completed a programming course and had knowledge at the Junior Front-end Developer level. Currently, my goal is to start work as soon as possible to use the newly learned knowledge in full-fledged projects and learn new issues.</p>
